# Power-of-Maths

This repository contains a fully-functional math web application built using various AWS services, including Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The application performs mathematical computations and stores the results in a DynamoDB database. Below are the details and setup instructions for the project.

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of several AWS services to create a responsive web application that performs math operations. Here's a summary of the components and their roles:

#### Amplify: Used to build and host the web application.
#### Lambda: Contains the code to perform mathematical computations.
#### API Gateway: Provides HTTP, REST, and WebSocket APIs to invoke the Lambda functions.
#### DynamoDB: Stores and retrieves the results of the math operations.
#### IAM: Manages permissions for executing Lambda functions.

# Features
##### User-friendly web interface for inputting mathematical expressions.
##### Real-time computation of results using AWS Lambda.
##### Secure and scalable API integration via API Gateway.
##### Persistent storage of computation results in DynamoDB.
##### Managed permissions and security using IAM roles.


# Prerequisites
#### Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

##### An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
##### AWS CLI installed and configured on your machine.
##### Amplify CLI installed.
